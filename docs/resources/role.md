You can use the `clickhousedbops_role` resource to create a `role` in a `ClickHouse` instance.

```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the role

### Optional

- `cluster_name` (String) Name of the cluster to create the resource into. If omitted, resource will be created on the replica hit by the query.
This field must be left null when using a ClickHouse Cloud cluster.
When using a self hosted ClickHouse instance, this field should only be set when there is more than one replica and you are not using 'replicated' storage for user_directory.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The system-assigned ID for the role

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Roles can be imported by specifying the ID.
# Find the ID of the role by checking system.roles table.
terraform import clickhousedbops_role.example xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

# It's also possible to import roles by name:

terraform import clickhousedbops_role.example rolename

# IMPORTANT: if you have a multi node cluster, you need to specify the cluster name!

terraform import clickhousedbops_role.example cluster:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
terraform import clickhousedbops_role.example cluster:rolename
```
